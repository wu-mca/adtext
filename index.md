title: Google Ad Text Creation
---

Many search engines, such as Google, offer the option to create and pay for advertisement that looks like a search result but is presented among the first positions to grasp a user's attention immediately.

These ads are usually distinguised by a small <span style="color:red">Visual cue</span>. They consist of link to the page, one or more Headlines and the main part, Descriptions.
            
Please note that these colored shapes are added by us to illustrate and do not appear in actual search results.

## How is a Google Ad created?

The creation of an ad is relatively straightforward. The creator enters keywords that are related to the topic and expected to be searched for by Google Search users. In the following examples, you see keywords entered by a company that repairs computers and mobile devices.

Then, the creator is asked to create several Headlines (three distinct headlines are required) and Descriptions (two distinct descriptions are required), that are then randomly presented to the users of Google Search.
